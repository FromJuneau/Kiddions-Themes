To add the themes in this repository you simply add them to the Themes file.

Step-by-step tutorial coming up:

1. Open up the map in which your Modest Menu launcher is in along with all other Modest Menu files.

2. Open the .txt file called Themes.

3. Scroll to the bottom.

4. When you are at the bottom keep the ] and } symbols below the theme 'code' lines.

5. After the line  
"ItemSpacing" : 0
add a comma (,) behind the }

6. Copy and paste the whole theme 'code' you want to use.

It should look like this if it goes successfully and it's been added at the bottom of all other theme

    {
      "Name" : "Callamastia",
      "FontName" : "DejaVu",
      "ItemColor" : "0D0C1E",
      "TextColor" : "ffffff",
      "SelectedItemColor" : "87286D",
      "SelectedTextColor" : "ffffff",
      "BackgroundColor" : "0c081b",
      "TransparencyColorKey" : "000000",
      "ItemHeight" : 20,
      "ItemWidth" : 340,
      "ItemSpacing" : 0
    },
    {
      "Name" : "Juneau",
      "FontName" : "DejaVu",
      "ItemColor" : "014d41",
      "TextColor" : "ffffff",
      "SelectedItemColor" : "0ba779",
      "SelectedTextColor" : "ffffff",
      "BackgroundColor" : "004b5e",
      "TransparencyColorKey" : "000000",
      "ItemHeight" : 20,
      "ItemWidth" : 340,
      "ItemSpacing" : 0
    }
  ]
}

Note: the 2 symbols on line 47 and 48 close the themes folder and shoul not be altered.

If your theme order looks like this at the bottom and you already launched the menu just reload the themes in the settings area and select + save confid afterwards.
